# Eniac Magist Project

## Summary
Business propuse: to recommend whether or not to sign the deal with Magist. Based on a clear story created from the information provided from the given dataset and own research about the Brazilian market, like current trends, business opportunities, and competitors.
There are two main concerns:
1. Eniac’s catalogue is 100% tech products and heavily based on Apple-compatible accessories. It is not clear that Magist is a good partner for these high-end tech products.
2. Among Eniac’s efforts to have happy customers, fast deliveries are key. The delivery fees resulting from Magist’s deal with the public Post Office might be cheap, but at what cost? Are deliveries fast enough?
## Languages and Tools Used
SQL, Tableu

## Key Learnings
Practiced SQL with the Magist database to understand the schema, explored the tables and answered business questions to perform an overview to the main concerns exposed above. 
Used Tableu to visualize and present data

## Challenges Overcame
The SQL queries to obtain the bussiness questions were complicated therefore much time were spent on this part. Understand the Tableu functionalities in order to create the graphs was complex
